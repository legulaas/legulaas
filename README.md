<h2 align="left"> 💬 About Me </h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.5">
  Hi! My name is Matheus de Andrade Fragoso, I'm 19 years old, I live in Sorocaba, SP, Brazil and  I study Computer Engineering at the University of Sorocaba (UNISO).
  I started as a developer in early 2022 after finishing my high school and joining university. The first programming language I learned to develop was Python. After that, I joined my current job as a Web and Mobile Developer where I acquired skills with JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. 
  In this year of 2023 I started to study programming in C# and Java. I acquired courses in these languages to become a complete and up-to-date developer according to the job market. I am open to new job opportunities to consolidate my career.</p>
